#### What is `XOR` (operator: `^`)? 
`Returns a 1 in each bit position for which the corresponding bits of either but not both operands are 1's.`

XOR Example:
```
val = x ^ y
x = 5 =     0101 // 5 is 0101 in binary
y = 2 =     0010
// Different ↑↑↑
// (Set bit to 1 if different, 0 if same)
val = 0111 = 7
```

#### What is bitwise `AND` (operator: `&`) ?

`Returns a 1 in each bit position for which the corresponding bits of both operands are 1's.`

AND Example:
```
val = x & y
x = 7 =  0111
y = 2 =  0010
// Same    ↑
// (Set bit to 1 if both are 1, 0 if not)
val = 0010 = 2
```
